### Descent Algo

Here is the code for the descent algorithm.  I have a description of the algorithm as explained by GitHub Copilot.  The key step is a function to remove certain elements from the permutation, called [[Descent Algorithm#Remover|remover]].

```python
def descent_algo(p):
	"""
	Perform the descent algorithm on a given list of integers.
	  
	Args:
	p (list): The input list of integers.
	
	Returns:
	tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
	- a (list): The resulting list after performing the descent algorithm.
	- deg (dict): A dictionary containing the degrees of each step in the algorithm.
	"""
	pp = list(p)
	i = 0
	a = [0 for _ in sorted(p)]
	deg = {i: 0 for i in range(2 * len(p))}
	
	while pp != sorted(pp):
		pq = remover(pp)
		d = desc(pq)
		i += 1
		deg[i] = d
		pp = remove(pp, pq)
		a = sequence(a, pq, i)
	
	deg = {i: deg[i] for i in deg.keys() if deg[i] != 0}
	
	return a, deg
```

The `descent_algo(p)` function performs the descent algorithm on a list of integers. It initializes 
* a copy of the (*partial*) permutation, 
* a counter, 
* a list the same length as the permutation that is initially all zeros, and 
* a dictionary to record the number of descents.  

The function then enters a loop that continues until the list is sorted in ascending order.  As the algorithm iterates, the list of zeros and dictionary change into a `marked code` as defined in the Stembridge paper. 

In each iteration, the function identifies a sublist that needs to be removed, calculates the number of descents, increments the counter, assigns the number of descents to the dictionary, removes the sublist from the (partial) permutation, and updates the list of zeros by setting the positions found in the sublist to the value of the counter. The loop continues until the list is sorted in increasing order.

### Remover

The main tool in the descent algorithm is the remover function.

```python
def remover(pp):
    """
    Identifies elements to be removed from a list based on certain conditions.

    Args:
        pp (list): The input list.

    Returns:
        list: The list of .

    """
    if pp == []:
        return pp
    N = pp.index(max(pp))
    if N == len(pp) - 1:
        return remover(pp[:-1])
    elif N > 0:
        return remover(pp[N:])
    else: # the max is at the beginning
	    # find the valleys in the substring
        valleys = find_valleys(pp) 
        # return the substring if no valleys 
        if len(valleys) == 0:  
            return pp
        else:
            v = min(valleys)  # pick the first valley
            # look at the descents after the first valley
            des_v = descents(pp[v:])  
            if des_v != []:  # if descents then recurse
                return remover(pp[v:])
            else: # check if the rest of permutation climbs above the descent before the valley
                climbs = [j for j in pp[v:] if (j > pp[v - 1])]
                if climbs == []:                    
                    return pp
                else:
                    j = min(climbs)
                    return [i for i in pp if (i < j)]
```

The `remover` function identifies and removes certain elements from a list based on specific conditions. If the list is empty, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it finds the index of the maximum value in the list.

If the maximum value is at the end of the list, the function calls itself recursively with the list excluding the last element. If the maximum value is somewhere in the middle of the list, the function calls itself recursively with the sublist starting from the maximum value. If the maximum value is at the beginning of the list, the function finds the "valleys" in the list.

If there are no valleys in the list, the function returns the list as is. If there are valleys, it picks the first valley and looks at the "descents" after the valley. If there are descents after the valley, the function calls itself recursively with the sublist starting from the valley. If there are no descents after the valley, it checks if the rest of the list after the valley climbs above the element before the valley.

If there are no climbs, the function returns the list as is. If there are climbs, it finds the smallest climb and returns a new list containing elements in the list that are smaller than the climb.
